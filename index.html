    <h1>Falling for the skyscrapers of Dubai</h1>

    <p>There is no denying that the Dubai skyscrapers collectively are impressive, yet one lone, astonishingly tall tower rises high above them all; standing sentinel, quietly watching the vibrant city at its feet.

        If you have ever read my tale about overcoming my fear of heights in Bologna, you may well have questioned my sanity had you borne witness to my excitement at the prospect of ascending the Burj Khalifa, the tallest building in the world. (I think skipping was involved but let’s keep that just between us if that’s OK.)
        
        And what a sight it is, glistening in the morning sunshine before a backdrop of deep blue sky with only a smattering of white, wispy clouds floating by. It took six years to build, finishing in 2010. Its potential successor, Kingdom Tower in Jeddah, on the banks of the Red Sea in Saudi Arabia, will be a staggering kilometre in height and was started last year. 
        But for now, at least, the Burj Khalifa still reigns supreme as the tallest building in the world.</p>
