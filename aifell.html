    <p>Whether it was in the History textbooks or in the Bollywood dance numbers, it can be said with absolute certainty that everyone would have seen the architectural marvel of Eiffel Tower in Paris at least once in their lifetime and dreamt of seeing it with naked eyes. The 324 meters tall Iron lady has been standing tall in the French capital for 130 years and it is one of the best places to visit in Europe. It is not only a tourist attraction but also a symbol to commemorate the French revolution. Despite the sightseeing, there will be light
         shows and world-famous events. No wonder it is one of the seven wonders of the world as listed by the UNESCO.</p>
